This may not be a story that will resonate with everyone. But in that singular atmosphere, beneath layers of tension, fear, and quiet suffocation, a sudden moment of kindness can even “burn” the one who has long been curled inward, like a flower blooming on the edge of a cliff.

<p>
Have you ever had one of those days? From the moment you open your eyes, you’re filled with excitement for everything the day might bring—but somehow, it seems like everyone forgot your birthday.
Don’t be sad. This little Bitsy game will always remember. Come back and open it on that special day each year, and it will always be here to celebrate with you. 
Happy Birthday!
